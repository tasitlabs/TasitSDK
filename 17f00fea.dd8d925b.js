Some dapps can be used inside a single app like Coinbase Wallet or Status that serves as a dapp browser, but this feels like a terribly broken UX for anyone who has been using a mobile phone for a while, and it also feels like broken UX for people who are used to using web-based dapps with MetaMask (where the wallet mostly stays out of the way until you need it).
