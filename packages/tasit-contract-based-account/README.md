# `tasit-contract-based-account`

This package helps with onboarding a user using a smart-contract-based "account". Examples of such smart-contract-based accounts include the [Gnosis Safe](https://safe.gnosis.io/) and [universal login](https://universallogin.io/).

This functionality all "lives" in `tasit-contract-based-account`, a child package of the [`tasit-sdk`](https://github.com/tasitlabs/TasitSDK) that is also published to npm as a standalone module using [lerna](https://lernajs.io/).

[For context, here is an overview](https://github.com/tasitlabs/TasitSDK/blob/develop/README.md#for-users-new-to-ethereum-with-no-funds) of how this fits in with the rest of the Tasit SDK in the [onboarding section](https://github.com/tasitlabs/TasitSDK/blob/develop/README.md#onboarding). But this can be used as a stand-alone, modular package if you prefer!
