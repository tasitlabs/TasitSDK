# `@tasit/contracts`

This package contains the smart contracts (and tests, etc.) from a few of the most popular dapps.

`tasit-contracts` contains a collection of the latest smart contracts from major projects. This package could be a useful standalone utility even when used outside of the context of the Tasit SDK. Developers can use this package for testing their own libraries too.

This functionality all "lives" in `@tasit/contracts`, a child package of the [`@tasit/sdk`](https://github.com/tasitlabs/tasit-sdk) that is also published to npm as a standalone module using [lerna](https://lernajs.io/).

For context, here is an [overview of how this fits in with the rest of the Tasit SDK](https://docs.tasit.io/docs/project-layout). But this can be used as a stand-alone, modular package if you prefer!
