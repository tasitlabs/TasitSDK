# `@tasit/link-wallet`

This package helps with onboarding a user by linking a dapp with a wallet of their choosing. This can be done either using ERC20 and ERC721 approve functions or using WalletConnect.

**Important note**

This onboarding-related child package is still in a _coming soon_ state.
